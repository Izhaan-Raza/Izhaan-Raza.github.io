In the vast digital landscape, I'm just a student wielding the basics of networking, cybersecurity, and the wizardry of Linux. Picture me as an apprentice, cautiously exploring the realms of Metasploit and dipping toes into the cybersecurity pond. With a beginner's wand, I navigate the binary maze, learning the language of codes and algorithms. Networking and Linux are my training grounds, and Metasploit is my playmate in this digital sandbox.

I may not be a professional, just a humble student unraveling the mysteries of technology. In this journey, every line of code is a lesson, every challenge an opportunity to grow. So, while I may not have a corner office or a title, what I do have is a passion for learning and a curiosity that propels me into the exciting world of tech exploration. That's what I do â€“ a student, embracing the adventure of turning tech curiosity into a journey of discovery.
